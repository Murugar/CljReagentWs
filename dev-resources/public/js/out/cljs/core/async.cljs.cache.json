If no operation is\n  ready and a :default value is supplied, [default-val :default] will\n  be returned, otherwise alts! will park until the first operation to\n  become ready completes. Returns [val port] of the completed\n  operation, where val is the value taken for takes, and a\n  boolean (true unless already closed, as per put!) for puts.\n\n  opts are passed as :key val ... Supported options:\n\n  :default val - the value to use if none of the operations are immediately ready\n  :priority true - (default nil) when true, the operations will be tried in order.\n\n  Note: there is no guarantee that the port exps or val exprs will be\n  used, nor in what order should they be, so they should not be\n  depended upon for side effects."],"~$unsub",["^ ","^1E",null,"^13",["^ ","^W","/home/iqmsoft/clojure/rente/dev-resources/public/js/out/cljs/core/async.cljs","^[",657,"^Z",7,"^14",657,"^15",12,"^1F",["^19",["^1G",["^19",[["~$p","^4T","^1="]]]]],"^16","Unsubscribes a channel from a topic of a pub"],"^=","~$cljs.core.async/unsub","^1J",false,"^W","dev-resources/public/js/out/cljs/core/async.cljs","^15",12,"^1K",["^19",[["~$p","^4T","^1="]]],"^1L",null,"^1M",["^19",[null,null]],"^Z",1,"^[",657,"^14",657,"^1N",3,"^1O",true,"^1F",["^19",["^1G",["^19",[["~$p","^4T","^1="]]]]],"^16","Unsubscribes a channel from a topic of a pub"],"~$poll!",["^ ","^1E",null,"^13",["^ ","^W","/home/iqmsoft/clojure/rente/dev-resources/public/js/out/cljs/core/async.cljs","^[",231,"^Z",7,"^14",231,"^15",12,"^1F",["^19",["^1G",["^19",[["^2R"]]]]],"^16","Takes a val from port if it's possible to do so immediately.\n  Never blocks.
